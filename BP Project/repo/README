Machine learning codes for Blood Pressure estimation from ECG and PPG signals


1. preprocessing.m

Input : Raw Signal (ecg/ppg/abp)
Output : Preprocessed Signal after applying wavelet transform
(see code for more comments)

2. feature_extraction.m

Input : Preprocessed ecg, ppg and abp signal in separate (3) variables
Output : Extracted parameter based and whole based features in separate (2) variables
(see code for more comments)

3. regg.m

Script to collect features from all ecg and ppg signals
as well as SBP and DBP from abp signals.
(see code for more comments)

4. test_validation.m

Script to train and validate the model as well as test on new data using Linear Regression, Random Forrest and LS Boost.
(see code for more comments)

5. regg_para.m

Script to train and validate the model as well as test on new data using Decision Trees and SVM for parameter based features.
(see code for more comments)

6. regg_whole.m

Script to train and validate the model as well as test on new data using Decision Trees and SVM for whole based features.
(see code for more comments)

7. knee_pt.m

Supplementary code to calculate inflection point in ppg curve.
